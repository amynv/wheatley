Wheatley: A Wayland backend for Android
=======================================

This project aims to create an app for Android that allows the user to run
their Wayland-based desktop environment of choice inside a chroot
environment.  This app is *not* a full Wayland compositor by itself.  It is
only really capable of displaying other Wayland compositors.  For more
information on how I intend this to work, see also [libwlb][1].
